# FOMO
Automatic revision scheduler for UOM compsci students.

Unfortunately, due to limited access to the University hosted database this project only workes on UOM networks. You can view the fronted-end design [here](https://uom-fomo.netlify.app/), however the web app's core functionality can only be used when run locally.

## The Idea
Below is the main page of the web app. First a user is asked to upload their Uni timetable and asked to pick how long they would like to work for each day. Then the user can click the "Create Work Slots" button to generate timetabled slots for them to work in for upcoming deadlines. The web app was secured via the University login portal, meaning only UOM students could login to the page. This removed the possibility for spam accounts.
